# NAB Slider.js

## “Not another bloody slider...”

### A lightweight slider with controls and optional autoplay.

All the heavy lifting is done using some simple CSS/SASS, so **NAB Slider.js** is fully responisive and customizable right out of the box. All the jQuery does is add and remove the classes that trigger the CSS magic.
